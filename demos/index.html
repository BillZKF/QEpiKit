    <h1>QEpiKit - Javascript / Typescript Epidemiology Library</h1>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <div>This library is a collection of tools for compartmental (differential equation) (CDE) and agent based (AB) modeling of communicable (and noncommunicable!) disease. Although developed with the
      public health / epidemiology / biomedical domains in mind, the tools themselves are domain neutral, and may be useful in other areas. The library also integrates concepts from hybrid dynamic systems and reinforcement learning.
    </div>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <div>
      I started working on this library because I was trying to learn more about epidemiological modeling. In the process of writing code, I experimented with a number of different methods that are not frequently applied to epidemiology.
      I chose Typescript / Javascript as the main language because they: 1) enable interactive browser based examples on most devices 2) can also be run on a server 3) will allow migration to ES6.
