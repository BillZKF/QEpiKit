    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <div>
      Models have a few roles in epidemiology. They are used to forecast or predict future outcomes based on available data, they are used for projecting and comparing outcomes for a variety of scenarios, and they can be used to enhance understanding of causal
      relationships through evaluation of counterfactuals. In the next two sections, I'll provide brief introductions to two of the main types of models used in epidemiology with example code from this library. My views are neither authorataive
    </div>
    <h1>Compartment Models</h1>
    <div>
      Many introductions to epidemiological modeling start with a simple model with three compartments: Succeptible, Infectious, and Removed. Each compartment is assigned a starting population. Using ordinary differential equations (ODE), some portion of the
      Succeptible population flows into the Infectious compartment, while some portion of the Infectious population flows into the Removed compartment. The parameters determining the size of portion transitioning to the next compartment in these "SIR"
      examples are usually provided as 'beta' for the transmission rate (Succeptible to Infectious) and 'gamma' for the recovery rate (Infectious to Removed). I'm going to use 'transmission parameter' and 'recovery parameter' here. Below are two visualizations
      of this simple "SIR" model.
    </div>

    <div>
      The javascript code below shows how this example was created. The CompartmentModel class uses Heun's method (2nd order) differential equation solver. In the future, I'd like to implement an adaptive-step <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta%E2%80%93Fehlberg_method">Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg</a>      method.
    </div>
    <div>
      Contemporary compartment models are more sophisticated. They add additional compartments (like an exposed-latent period) relevant to the disease's pathology, population vital dynamics (births and deaths), environmental factors like weather / temperature,
      and frequently include spatial "patches" and modeling of travel patterns between patches.

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>Below I've included a more complex compartment model and code, demonstrating how some of these concepts can be implemented using this library.

    <div>Agent based models take a completely different approach. Instead of using a total population figure and moving a portion of that population between compartments, an agent is typically used to represent an individual within the population and is assigned
      a set of relevant and representative properties (like age, gender, body-mass, etc.). A set of agents, their behaviors and interactions is then modeled over a time period.
      Agent based models also frequently include models of the environment, and social contact patterns.
      </div>

    <h2>Hybrid Automata</h2>
    <div>One way to model agents and their behavior is to treat the agent as a <a href="http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~agung/course/vanderschaft.pdf">hybrid dynamic system (hds)</a>. This is a type of system with continuous and discrete variables and time dynamics.
      In practice it means using differential equations (for describing the behavior of continous state variables over time) and comparison operators (=, >=, !=) at continuous value thresholds. I'll introduce the concept of hds and hybrid automata with
      a canonical example of an air conditioner:</div>
    <div>
      This basic air conditioner:
      <ol>
        <li>Can be ON or OFF. These discrete states are elements of the AC's
          <strong>set of modes</strong> = [ON, OFF].</li>
        <li>Checks the environment's temperature "x", which is a continuous variable and is part of this system's continous state space or
          <strong>flow set</strong> = {x : [0:100]}.
          <li>When it is OFF, the temperature goes up (towards 85), and when it's ON the air conditioner blasts 65 degree air. When represented as a set of differential equations (or vector fields), this is called the
            <strong>flow map</strong> ={x: {ON:65 - x, OFF:85 - x}}.</li>
          <li>Knows when to switch modes based of the current temperature. This is called the
            <strong>jump set</strong> = {ON:{x >= 74}, OFF:{x
            <=71}}. </li>
              <li>Should know whether anything special happens to "x" when we go from ON to OFF or OFF to ON. In this example, it doesn't so the
                <strong>jump map</strong> is just = {ON=>OFF(x):x, OFF=>ON(x):x}.</li>
              <li>We also want to be explicit that the air conditioner can go from ON to OFF and OFF to ON. These are called
                <strong>edges</strong> = [[ON,OFF], [OFF,ON]]</li>
      </ol>
      <div id="ac-diagram"></div>
    </div>
    <div>
      Based on this very simple example, it may be hard to see exactly how these concepts are applied to epidemiological modeling. Let's consider a simplified infectious disease model spreading through (doesn't have to, but should be) an English boardings school
      with 500 students:
      <ol>
        <li>We'll say that the modes = [SUCCEPTIBLE, INFECTIOUS, LATENT]</li>
        <li>The flow set will contain the person's pathogen shedding rate = [1 : 10], immune response = [1:100] and pathogen load = [1 :1000]</li>
        <li>The flow map is more involved this time.
          <pre>embed gist
          </pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          The jump set will include = { INFECTIOUS:{agent.load >= 100}, LATENT:{agent.load
          <=50} } </li>
            <li>
              The jump map will not be anything but identity as above.
            </li>
            <li>
              The edges include = [[SUCCEPTIBLE, INFECTIOUS][INFECTIOUS,LATENT]]
            </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="ha-contact-graph"></div>
    <div id="ha-contact-diagram"></div>
    <div>
      If the individual was between 3 and 18 years of age they were assigned to schools of ~600 students, individuals between 19 and 65 were assigned to a workplace of up to 500, and
      all individuals were also assigned to a community-patch with a population of ~1000. Children 18 and under were also assigned a parent.
