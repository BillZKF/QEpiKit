  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>This is a demo of a decision aid for the SPHERE guidelines. The demo can be run on the phones of fieldworkers as a standalone mobile app and / or connect to a local network server (running on someone's laptop over local wifi). Where internet access is available, larger scale models (50000+ agents) could also be pushed to the cloud.</p>

  <h2>How it Works</h2>
  <p>
    In this demo, the resource-use forecast is based on a simple agent based model. At each 1 day time-step (0:60), each agent evaluates a behavior-tree depth-first - according to rules described in <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=6907656"> Marzinotto, et al (2014)</a>. Below is a diagram of the camp-residents' behavior tree.

  <p>
    As the agent based model runs, the available resources are checked against the SPHERE guidelines every 10 days. Once the model has run for the desired # of days (60 by default), if barriers, like not having enough water, were encountered during the model's run, those barriers get reported in the forecast.
    Once the user receives notification of the barrier, they have the option of "searching" (evaluating a hierarchal task network) for a solution.
